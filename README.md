# Iris-Prediction-Using-SVM
Conclusion for SVM model each different type of kernel for liner, polynomial degree 2, rbf, and sigmoid resulting in the same accurancy score of 0.83.
All of the kernel also have an unclear division of hyperplane to categorize the species in "sepal length (cm)" and "sepal width (cm)".
Further testing needed to identify which kernel could increase the accuracy score for a better model prediction.
